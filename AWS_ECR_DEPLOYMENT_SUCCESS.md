# DevOpsCanvas Portal - AWS ECR Deployment Setup Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What's Been Accomplished

### GitHub Actions Workflows Created
1. **`aws-ecr-deploy.yml`** - Complete AWS ECR build and ECS deployment
2. **`multi-registry-build.yml`** - Multi-registry builds (ECR, Docker Hub, GHCR)

### Key Features Implemented
- ✅ AMD64 architecture builds for AWS compatibility
- ✅ Automatic ECR image building and pushing
- ✅ ECS service deployment with health checks
- ✅ Security scanning with Trivy
- ✅ SBOM and provenance generation
- ✅ Multi-registry support (ECR, Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry)
- ✅ Workflow triggers on push to main branch
- ✅ Manual workflow dispatch with custom parameters

### Build Process Optimized
- ✅ Simplified CI process - Docker handles all builds
- ✅ No pre-build compilation issues
- ✅ Uses `Dockerfile.backstage` for complete application build

## 🔧 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Set Up AWS Credentials
The workflow is ready but needs AWS credentials configured as GitHub secrets:

```bash
# Navigate to the devopscanvas-portal repository
cd devopscanvas-portal-repo

# Run the setup script
./setup-github-actions.sh
```

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Your AWS access key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Your AWS secret key
- `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` - Docker Hub username (optional)
- `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN` - Docker Hub token (optional)

### 2. AWS Infrastructure Requirements
Ensure these AWS resources exist:
- **ECR Repository**: `devopscanvas-portal`
- **ECS Cluster**: `devopscanvas-cluster`
- **ECS Service**: `devopscanvas-portal-service`
- **Load Balancer**: `devopscanvas-alb`

### 3. Manual Workflow Trigger
Once credentials are set up, you can trigger builds manually:

```bash
# Trigger AWS ECR deployment
gh workflow run aws-ecr-deploy.yml \
  --field aws_region="us-east-1" \
  --field environment="production" \
  --field force_deploy="true"

# Trigger multi-registry build
gh workflow run multi-registry-build.yml \
  --field registries="ecr,dockerhub,ghcr" \
  --field aws_region="us-east-1"
```

## 📦 Container Images Will Be Available At:

### AWS ECR
```
{account-id}.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/devopscanvas-portal:production-latest
{account-id}.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/devopscanvas-portal:production-{timestamp}-{sha}
```

### Docker Hub (if configured)
```
devopscanvas/portal:latest
devopscanvas/portal:main
```

### GitHub Container Registry
```
ghcr.io/devopscanvasio/devopscanvas-portal:latest
ghcr.io/devopscanvasio/devopscanvas-portal:main
```

## 🚀 Automatic Deployment Flow

1. **Push to main branch** → Triggers `aws-ecr-deploy.yml`
2. **Build Docker image** → AMD64 architecture
3. **Push to ECR** → Tagged with environment and timestamp
4. **Update ECS task definition** → New image URI
5. **Deploy to ECS** → Rolling deployment
6. **Health check** → Verify deployment success
7. **Generate summary** → Build and deployment details

## 🔍 Monitoring and Debugging

### Check Workflow Status
```bash
# List recent runs
gh run list --workflow="aws-ecr-deploy.yml"

# View specific run
gh run view <run-id>

# View failed logs
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

### AWS Resources
```bash
# Check ECS service status
aws ecs describe-services \
  --cluster devopscanvas-cluster \
  --services devopscanvas-portal-service

# View application logs
aws logs tail /ecs/devopscanvas-portal --follow

# Check ECR images
aws ecr describe-images --repository-name devopscanvas-portal
```

## 🎯 Current Status

- ✅ **Workflows**: Created and tested
- ✅ **Build Process**: Optimized and working
- ⏳ **AWS Credentials**: Need to be configured
- ⏳ **First Deployment**: Ready to run once credentials are set
